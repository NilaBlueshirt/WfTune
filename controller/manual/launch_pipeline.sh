# Manual step 2 of 5, as the benchmark user.
#
# Usage: launch_pipeline.sh MONITOR_RUN_DIR
#
# Replays the sbatch invocation that start_monitor.sh published for this run
# and records the measured t0 immediately before it.  Everything the automated
# controller would have placed on the command line comes from the root-owned
# launch spec, so a manual treatment carries the same account, partition, QoS,
# constraint, output paths, and --export contract as an automated one.
#
# Nothing here queries Slurm for status.  A benchmark-user squeue, sacct, or
# scontrol call between this step and the endpoint mark is charged to the
# benchmark user's sdiag row and inflates the very number the study reports.

Do not run squeue, sacct, or scontrol as $BENCH_USER for the rest of this run.
The measured window stays open until root closes it, so a Slurm query from this
account lands in the measured row. Watch the trace instead, or watch from the
root session.

When every expected endpoint task has completed, cancel the main job from here:
