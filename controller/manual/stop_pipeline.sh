# Manual step 4 of 5, as the benchmark user.
#
# Usage: stop_pipeline.sh MONITOR_RUN_DIR [--wait-seconds N] [--abandon]
#
# Cancels the main job at the configured scientific endpoint.  The pipeline does not
# stop itself there, so this cancellation stands in for the automated runner's
# stage-limited exit: it triggers the same teardown of the per-task jobs and the
# downstream work, and the measured window stays open across that teardown in
# both modes.  The cancellation instant is therefore the endpoint itself, not a
# separate boundary declared beforehand.
#
# The endpoint gate is checked here, from the trace only, so the run cannot be
# cancelled before every expected endpoint task has completed.  Reading the trace
# issues no Slurm command; a squeue from this account would land on the
# benchmark user's sdiag row inside the measured window.
#
# --abandon cancels a run that has not reached the endpoint.  Such a run is not
# paper data; use it to clear a broken attempt before archiving its directories.
