"""Plot how benchmark-user RPC stress accumulates over a run, for all five
backends.

Standalone diagnostic.  The paper's primary figure carries this view as its
lower row, drawn by ``plot_walltime_stress.py`` in the frontier's own
normalized count units. This script also offers the processing-time sensitivity
series through ``--metric processing-time`` without a second paper figure.

With ``--metric count``, the figure resolves the frontier's scalar in time: how
fast each deployment strategy asks Slurm for work from clean start ``t0`` through
the post-run boundary.

It is derived from the per-user ``sdiag`` rows captured beside every periodic
snapshot, not from the Nextflow trace.  That is what makes it cover every
backend.  A trace-derived submission curve can only describe native and job
array, because ``native_id`` is a Slurm identifier for those two alone;
``sdiag`` attributes by UID and therefore measures HyperQueue, Flux, and local
on the same footing.

Each replicate is drawn as a thin curve and each backend's median across
replicates as a bold one.  Curves are held at their final value past their own
endpoint, so a finished run plateaus rather than disappearing from the median.
The last point of every curve is the post-run boundary, so its height is exactly
the boundary-to-boundary delta the frontier plots.
